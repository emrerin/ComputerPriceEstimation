# ComputerPriceEstimation

I created a dataset in Excel for an experimental purpose of 208 lines. I manually entered the properties of a computer in this
dataset. Later on I used this raw data to process it using Weka.

Finally, I created a JAVA application template to do real-time computer price estimation using Azure ML RSS API.
